## About This Repository

I'm not a professional programmer — this repository serves as a place to store and share the scripts I personally use in my work environment. These scripts were created to solve real-world problems I encountered in daily IT operations, system administration, and network management.

Feel free to use, adapt, and redistribute any of these scripts. Attribution is appreciated (mention the original author), but not required.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** I do not take any responsibility for any issues, data loss, misconfigurations, or damage that may result from the use or misuse of these scripts. Always review and test code in your own environment before deploying it in production.
