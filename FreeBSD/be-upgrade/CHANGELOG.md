# Changelog

## v0.2
- Late color initialization (so `--no-color` applies).
- Ensure mountpoint directory exists (`mkdir -p`).
- Stronger marker handling (permissions, validation, custom path).
- `--test-marker` diagnostic sub-command.
- More robust mount detection and clearer messaging.

## v0.1
- Initial public version with temporary/permanent activation, promote-after-reboot flow, and marker writer.
