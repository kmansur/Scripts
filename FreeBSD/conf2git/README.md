\# conf2git



`conf2git` is a lightweight shell script that exports system configuration directories into a Git repository.  

It is designed for environments with multiple servers (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) where you want to keep track of changes in `/etc`, `/usr/local/etc`, or any other critical configuration files â€” with per-host isolation.

\## Features



\- \*\*Sparse-checkout\*\*  

&nbsp; Each host only sees its own subtree (`$OS/$HOSTNAME\_SHORT`) inside the repository.



\- \*\*Self-update\*\*  

&nbsp; On every run the script checks for updates.  

&nbsp; If `AUTO\_UPDATE="yes"`, it replaces itself with the latest version from the configured `UPDATE\_URL`.  

&nbsp; If `AUTO\_UPDATE="no"`, it warns when an update is available.



\- \*\*Lockfile\*\*  

&nbsp; Prevents concurrent executions (`/var/run/conf2git.lock` by default).



\- \*\*Dry-run mode\*\*  

&nbsp; Simulate synchronization and commits without touching the repository.



\- \*\*Configurable Git identity\*\*  

&nbsp; Each commit can use a dedicated Git user (e.g. `Backup Bot`).



\- \*\*Logging\*\*  

&nbsp; Appends all actions to a configurable log file.
